The quarterly Australian GDP reconciliation forecasts from Income and Expenditure sides (Athanasopoulos et al., 2019).

## Files

**Note:** the analysis folders are divided by the two different hierarchies. _TYPE_ can indicate Income/INC or Expenditure/EXP.

* **BaseForecasts**: scripts to use the base forecasts in Bisaglia (2020) and to calculate the naive forecasts:
  - `TYPE/TYPE_features_snaive.R`: Seasonal Random Walk forecasts and ARIMA base forecasts dataset;
  - `TYPE/TYPE_features_sa.R`: Seasonal Average forecasts.

* **Reconciliation**: 
  - `TYPE/ARIMA`:
    * `TYPE_cslccd_bCCCred.R`: LCC with ARIMA bts
    * `TYPE_cslccd_bLCC.R`: LxCC with ARIMA bts (x = number of level)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_mean_red.R`: LCC with SRW bts
    * `TYPE_cslccd_mean.R`: CCC with SRW bts
    * `TYPE_cslccd_mLCC.R`: LxCC with SRW bts (x = number of level)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_sa.R`: CCC with SA bts
    * `TYPE_cslccd.R`: CCC with ARIMA bts and CCCH
    * `TYPE_htsrec_mean.R`: cross-sectional reconciliation with SRW bts
    * `TYPE_htsrec.R`: cross-sectional reconciliation with ARIMA bts
    * `TYPE_CCCmix_red.R`: sample average of LCC (SRW + ARIMA bts)
    * `TYPE_CCCmix.R`: sample average of CCC (SRW + ARIMA bts)
    * `TYPE_csmix.R`: sample average of the cross-sectional reconciliation (SRW + ARIMA bts)
  - `TYPE/function`: functions for `TYPE/score/TYPE_scores_arima.R` 
  - `TYPE/score/TYPE_scores_arima.R`: returns the scores' dataset
