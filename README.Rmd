Forecast combination based reconciliation of the quarterly Australian GDP from Income and Expenditure sides (Di Fonzo and Girolimetto, 2022)

The forecast reconciliation is performed using **FoReco 0.2.2**.

## Files

**Note:** the analysis folders are distinct according to two different hierarchies. _TYPE_ stands for either Income/INC or Expenditure/EXP.

* **BaseForecasts**: Base forecasts as in Athanasopoulos et al. (2019) and naive forecasts (SA and SRW):
  - `TYPE/TYPE_features_snaive.R`: Seasonal Random Walk (SRW) and ARIMA base forecasts;
  - `TYPE/TYPE_features_sa.R`: Seasonal Average (SA) base forecasts.

* **Reconciliation**: 
  - `TYPE/ARIMA`:
    * `TYPE_cslccd_bCCCred.R`: LCC with ARIMA bts (exogenous)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_bCCCred_endo.R`: LCC with ARIMA bts (endogenous)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_bLCC.R`: LxCC with ARIMA bts (x = level number, exogenous)
    * `INC_cslccd_bLCCendo.R`: LxCC with ARIMA bts (x = level number, endogenous)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_mean_red.R`: LCC with SRW bts (exogenous)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_mean_red_endo.R`: LCC with SRW bts (endogenous)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_mean.R`: CCC with SRW bts
    * `TYPE_cslccd_mLCC.R`: LxCC with SRW bts (x = level number, exogenous)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_mLCCendo.R`: LxCC with SRW bts (x = level number, endogenous)
    * `TYPE_cslccd_sa.R`: CCC with SA bts
    * `TYPE_cslccd.R`: CCC with ARIMA bts and CCCH
    * `TYPE_htsrec_mean.R`: cross-sectional reconciliation with SRW bts
    * `TYPE_htsrec.R`: cross-sectional reconciliation with ARIMA bts
    * `TYPE_CCCmix_red.R`: sample average of LCC (SRW + ARIMA bts, exogenous)
    * `TYPE_CCCmix_red_endo.R`: sample average of LCC (SRW + ARIMA bts, endogenous)
    * `TYPE_CCCmix.R`: sample average of CCC (SRW + ARIMA bts, exogenous)
    * `TYPE_CCCmix_endo.R`: sample average of CCC (SRW + ARIMA bts, endogenous)
    * `TYPE_csmix.R`: sample average of the cross-sectional reconciliation (SRW + ARIMA bts)
  - `TYPE/function`: functions for `TYPE/score/TYPE_scores_arima.R` 
  - `TYPE/score/TYPE_scores_arima.R`: returns the scores' dataset
